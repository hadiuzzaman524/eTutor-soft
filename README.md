# eTutor-soft
This is a simple project for finding a teacher nearest to you. In this project, I build it depends on the MySQL database. when a teacher registered for getting tuition his/her information store in the database. when a student can find the teacher then retrieve the information and showing it to get a private tutor. Using this desktop software you can easily saw video tutorials and read books on the internet.
